# Rapper Image Classifier
This is a model of an image classifier for five rappers namely: Drake, Eminem, Ice Spice, Nicki Minaj, and Travis Scott. The simple UI interface for testing the data is based on HTML CSS and Javascript whereas the classification itself runs through a flask server using python code.
See the jupyer notebook file titled "rapper_classifier_model.ipynb" for an in depth analysis of the classifier and how it works along with the code, with sources provided at relevant points
